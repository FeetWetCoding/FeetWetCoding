<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts17">The Story of Mel</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts17"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts17">This was posted to Usenet by its author, Ed Nather (&lt;nather@astro.as.utexas.edu&gt;), on May 21, 1983.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts61"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">A recent article devoted to the macho side of programming</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">made the bald and unvarnished statement:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Real Programmers write in FORTRAN.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Maybe they do now,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">in this decadent era of</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Lite beer, hand calculators, and “user-friendly” software</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">but back in the Good Old Days,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">when the term “software” sounded funny</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Real Programmers wrote in machine code.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Not FORTRAN. &nbsp;Not RATFOR. &nbsp;Not, even, assembly language.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Machine Code.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Directly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Lest a whole new generation of programmers</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">grow up in ignorance of this glorious past,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I feel duty-bound to describe,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">as best I can through the generation gap,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">how a Real Programmer wrote code.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I'll call him Mel,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">because that was his name.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I first met Mel when I went to work for Royal McBee Computer Corp.,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">a now-defunct subsidiary of the typewriter company.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The firm manufactured the LGP-30,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">a small, cheap (by the standards of the day)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">drum-memory computer,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and had just started to manufacture</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the RPC-4000, a much-improved,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">bigger, better, faster — drum-memory computer.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Cores cost too much,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and weren't here to stay, anyway.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">(That's why you haven't heard of the company,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">or the computer.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I had been hired to write a FORTRAN compiler</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">for this new marvel and Mel was my guide to its wonders.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel didn't approve of compilers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">“If a program can't rewrite its own code”,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">he asked, “what good is it?”</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel had written,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">in hexadecimal,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the most popular computer program the company owned.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">It ran on the LGP-30</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and played blackjack with potential customers</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">at computer shows.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Its effect was always dramatic.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The LGP-30 booth was packed at every show,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and the IBM salesmen stood around</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">talking to each other.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Whether or not this actually sold computers</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">was a question we never discussed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel's job was to re-write</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the blackjack program for the RPC-4000.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">(Port? &nbsp;What does that mean?)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The new computer had a one-plus-one</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">addressing scheme,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">in which each machine instruction,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">in addition to the operation code</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and the address of the needed operand,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">had a second address that indicated where, on the revolving drum,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the next instruction was located.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">In modern parlance,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">every single instruction was followed by a GO TO!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Put that in Pascal's pipe and smoke it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel loved the RPC-4000</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">because he could optimize his code:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">that is, locate instructions on the drum</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so that just as one finished its job,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the next would be just arriving at the “read head”</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and available for immediate execution.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">There was a program to do that job,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">an “optimizing assembler”,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">but Mel refused to use it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">“You never know where it's going to put things”,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">he explained, “so you'd have to use separate constants”.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">It was a long time before I understood that remark.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Since Mel knew the numerical value</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">of every operation code,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and assigned his own drum addresses,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">every instruction he wrote could also be considered</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">a numerical constant.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He could pick up an earlier “add” instruction, say,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and multiply by it,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">if it had the right numeric value.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">His code was not easy for someone else to modify.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I compared Mel's hand-optimized programs</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">with the same code massaged by the optimizing assembler program,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and Mel's always ran faster.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">That was because the “top-down” method of program design</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">hadn't been invented yet,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and Mel wouldn't have used it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He wrote the innermost parts of his program loops first,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so they would get first choice</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">of the optimum address locations on the drum.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The optimizing assembler wasn't smart enough to do it that way.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel never wrote time-delay loops, either,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">even when the balky Flexowriter</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">required a delay between output characters to work right.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He just located instructions on the drum</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so each successive one was just past the read head</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">when it was needed;</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the drum had to execute another complete revolution</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">to find the next instruction.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He coined an unforgettable term for this procedure.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Although “optimum” is an absolute term,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">like “unique”, it became common verbal practice</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">to make it relative:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">“not quite optimum” or “less optimum”</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">or “not very optimum”.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel called the maximum time-delay locations</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the “most pessimum”.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">After he finished the blackjack program</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and got it to run</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">(“Even the initializer is optimized”,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">he said proudly),</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">he got a Change Request from the sales department.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The program used an elegant (optimized)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">random number generator</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">to shuffle the “cards” and deal from the “deck”,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and some of the salesmen felt it was too fair,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">since sometimes the customers lost.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">They wanted Mel to modify the program</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so, at the setting of a sense switch on the console,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">they could change the odds and let the customer win.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel balked.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He felt this was patently dishonest,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">which it was,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and that it impinged on his personal integrity as a programmer,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">which it did,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so he refused to do it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The Head Salesman talked to Mel,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">as did the Big Boss and, at the boss's urging,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">a few Fellow Programmers.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel finally gave in and wrote the code,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">but he got the test backwards,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and, when the sense switch was turned on,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the program would cheat, winning every time.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel was delighted with this,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">claiming his subconscious was uncontrollably ethical,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and adamantly refused to fix it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">After Mel had left the company for greener pa$ture$,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the Big Boss asked me to look at the code</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and see if I could find the test and reverse it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to look.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Tracking Mel's code was a real adventure.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I have often felt that programming is an art form,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">whose real value can only be appreciated</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">by another versed in the same arcane art;</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts106">there are lovely gems and brilliant coups</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts106">hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">by the very nature of the process.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">You can learn a lot about an individual</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">just by reading through his code,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">even in hexadecimal.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel was, I think, an unsung genius.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Perhaps my greatest shock came</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">when I found an innocent loop that had no test in it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">No test. &nbsp;None.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Common sense said it had to be a closed loop,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">where the program would circle, forever, endlessly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Program control passed right through it, however,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and safely out the other side.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">It took me two weeks to figure it out.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The RPC-4000 computer had a really modern facility</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">called an index register.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">It allowed the programmer to write a program loop</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">that used an indexed instruction inside;</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">each time through,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the number in the index register</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">was added to the address of that instruction,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so it would refer</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">to the next datum in a series.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He had only to increment the index register</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">each time through.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Mel never used it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Instead, he would pull the instruction into a machine register,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">add one to its address,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and store it back.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He would then execute the modified instruction</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">right from the register.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The loop was written so this additional execution time</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">was taken into account —</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">just as this instruction finished,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the next one was right under the drum's read head,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">ready to go.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">But the loop had no test in it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The vital clue came when I noticed</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the index register bit,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the bit that lay between the address</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and the operation code in the instruction word,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">was turned on —</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">yet Mel never used the index register,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">leaving it zero all the time.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">When the light went on it nearly blinded me.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He had located the data he was working on</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">near the top of memory —</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the largest locations the instructions could address —</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so, after the last datum was handled,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">incrementing the instruction address</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">would make it overflow.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">The carry would add one to the</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">operation code, changing it to the next one in the instruction set:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">a jump instruction.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">Sure enough, the next program instruction was</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">in address location zero,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and the program went happily on its way.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I haven't kept in touch with Mel,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">so I don't know if he ever gave in to the flood of</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">change that has washed over programming techniques</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">since those long-gone days.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I like to think he didn't.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">In any event,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I was impressed enough that I quit looking for the</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">offending test,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">telling the Big Boss I couldn't find it.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">He didn't seem surprised.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">When I left the company,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">the blackjack program would still cheat</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">if you turned on the right sense switch,</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">and I think that's how it should be.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">I didn't feel comfortable</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts58">hacking up the code of a Real Programmer.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
