<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts103">FeetWetCoding ToDo List</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps39"><span class="rvts15">Our love, more than our intelligence, will determine our future. &nbsp;Intelligence is an instrument of love: &nbsp;not the other way around.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Add task starting with date:description and do not delete when completed but strikethrough and move it to the bottom of it's section.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts110"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts121">IMPORTANT: When starting to write exercises in a section, try to make a first pass at covering the main topics in the section as 050_ex.cpp 100_ex.cpp 150_ex.cpp etc. to "spread" the topics out so that later exercises can be inserted and still retain proper sort order in the Qt Creator project file tree pane.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts7"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts14">Coding Tasks</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: Periodically go back and work through each exercise at a smaller screen resolution than what we have on these gigantic monitors that not everybody has.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts16">Bump up graphical work area to 800x600.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts16">Create exercise boundary box function that draws a box around the drawable area and displays box corner coordinates for student visual reference at runtime, with the option to divide the drawable area into a left hand side the student works in, with the right hand side being a QPixmap image that shows what the result is supposed to look like. &nbsp;Or should we just put the "it should look like this" on the helpndoc exercise page?</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: Add originalexercises directory, which contain original .cpp exercises so the student can restore them if s/he clobbers the exercise to the point where s/he has to start over.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts16">Change "feetwet" to "FeetWetCoding" in the entire codebase.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: Go online and look in programming textbooks for ideas about how to teach more than just these simple native language concepts, but rather how to put them together into more substantial programs. &nbsp;Teaching some discrete math concepts is a good idea for this as well.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: Decide on how we are going to provide color, and implement in a standardized way. &nbsp;QColor? &nbsp;RBG?</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: a0025.cpp teach random() and randomRange()</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">08Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts16">change HD license from WTFPL to BSD license or whatever is appropriate, throughout the project.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">19Jan2012: add mouseover tooltip to running exercise to show x,y coordinates</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">20Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts16">create SolutionDrawingAreaLocation class which contains either LEFTRIGHT or TOPBOTTOM. &nbsp;If LEFTRIGHT then all DrawLine, DrawCircle etc. x coordinates get 400 added to them, if TOPBOTTOM, then all Draw functions add 300 to y. &nbsp;This way, the solutions can have coordinates the student can relate to, and yet we don't have to create these solution .bmp screenshots by hand. &nbsp;In the puzzle, we call SolutionDrawingAreaLocation(LEFTRIGHT) or (TOPBOTTOM) so that the solution is drawn in the correct place, to set the flag in the class, but we don't call it in the solution, so if that is run directly from main() it draws on the original part of the drawing area. &nbsp;This requires a call at the top of main to SolutionDrawingAreaLocation(BLANK) to set the flag to nothing first, every time HandsDirty.exe runs.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">24Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts18">ALLOW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COLOR</span><span class="rvts104">BLIND</span><span class="rvts18"> FOR THE EXERCISE COLORS.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts16">25Jan2012: IMPORTANT: Figure out NOW what the exercise filenaming convention is going to be, because as exercises get added, it gets more and more expensive to change the naming convention. &nbsp;Renaming these files is really starting to suck.</span></li>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 48px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps4" style="margin-left: 0"><span class="rvts16">cc.ss.eee_NameX.cpp -- cc = chapter (01), ss = section (01), eee = exercise </span><span class="rvts106">series</span><span class="rvts16"> number (001), X = specific exercise in that series, like 01.01.005_Variables3.cpp would be the third exercise about variables in chapter 01 (C Basics), section 01 (Fundamentals), and eee is just used so we can sort in the order we want so the student sees the exercises in the right order, i.e. non-alphabetically. &nbsp;This allows us to add arbitrarily large numbers of exercises later on to any chapter, section, series or topic that we want, without hosing the display sort order and having exercises get out of order in the Qt Creator file display pane. &nbsp;This also saves us from the problem where under the old naming scheme we have 01-0010_A1.cpp and 01-0011_B1.cpp, and we need to add 01-0010_X.cpp where X should come between A1 and B1 but it can't now without renaming because of the alphabetical sort order in file display in Qt Creator. &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts106">This means creating at least a first attempt at a hierarchical topic outline by chapter, section and series, for the whole C++ learning process.</span></li>
</ul>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">25Jan2012: START GIT OVER WITH NEW rdholder &amp; jcdugger EMAIL ADDRESSES, AND NEW DIRECTORY STRUCTURE. &nbsp;CHANGE .bmp FILES TO .png FIRST TO MAKE THE REPO SMALLER.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">26Jan2012: can we add a copy of all the exercise/soln source directories to ~FeetWetCoding/restore read-only, but not add it to the project so that we don't have two copies of 01-01-010_exercise.cpp both trying to compile and generate errors? &nbsp;(This is for users to be able to restore an exercise to it's original state, in case they stomp on it to the point they can't figure out how to undo it.)</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">28Jan2012: </span><span class="rvts18">WE</span><span class="rvts11"> </span><span class="rvts109">NEED</span><span class="rvts11"> </span><span class="rvts104">MORE</span><span class="rvts11"> </span><span class="rvts108">COLORS</span><span class="rvts11">! &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts10">Add more QColors so exercises aren't so Blappy.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">28Jan2012: Try to reproduce Qt Creator deleting files (or was it git?) on filesystem when unsaved changed exist in .pro file when a file rename operation is performed within the IDE. &nbsp;If reproducible, report bug jira (or whatever it's called) after searching for an existing bug report. &nbsp;Also, make a gotcha lesson out of this.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">29Jan2012: Create text output widget that either displays the cout stream or a seeout stream, at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;Should be resizable and scrollable. &nbsp;Also, modify the Draw... tools so that a flag can cause them to display their name and parameter values in the cout or seeout widget.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">29Jan2012: Figure out whether to do the documentation on wiki or joomla or what. &nbsp;Find a wiki forum to ask how to prevent seo scammers from adding garbage link pages to the wiki, and generally what the right way is to set up the wiki so that there is a group that can edit pages, but just anyone who creates an account must be approved first before being able to edit pages.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">29Jan2012: Setup robert for irc, jabber, etc. etc. contact info in documentation.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">29Jan2012: Add note somewhere explaining to the user not to change FeetWetCoding.pro until they are more experienced.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">29Jan2012: Somehow, we have to communicate to the user that while the Soln code is in the same x coordinates for LEFTRIGHT </span><span class="rvts59">in the code</span><span class="rvts11">, it is shifted in the display during execution. &nbsp;We must anticipate that there will be a moment for many users where they will look at the 800,0 coordinates in the top right corner of the reference box and become confused about the coordinate space. &nbsp;Maybe change "Gsoln" to "GsolnShift" or something?</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: add scale to DrawImage(), add a DrawImageCentered() and add scale and rotation to it.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: make a fullsize version where user has the whole window to play with, </span><span class="rvts53">one</span><span class="rvts10"> big drawing area on top, and </span><span class="rvts53">one</span><span class="rvts10"> seeout widget on the bottom.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">1Feb2012: &nbsp;Is current GetsAndPlusGets a dirty trick? &nbsp;Maybe shouldn't do that to the poor users... maybe the kind of thing for a later lesson.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">1Feb2012: WhileLoop exercises coordinates are hosed (&gt; 400).</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">1Feb2012: Fix/Relocate or delete stuff like colortest, drawingpuzzlesIdea1 etc.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts115">2Feb2012: GROUNDHOG DAY!!! What is this, Miami Beach?! &nbsp;Not hardly! Add exercises to Variables_Types for extern, constants, and the idea of scope. &nbsp;You will have to use functions, that's ok, just make it a &gt; 500 exercise and note that functions are covered elsewhere.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">3Feb2012: GOTCHA: &nbsp;if they accidentally doubleclick by the line numbers in the edit window in debug mode, they will set a breakpoint! Hmm, where to put this warning?... also clicking the tiny triangle by the numbers collapses that section of code, which will be confusing.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts119">3Feb2012: Proofread all comment headers! &nbsp;Start filling them out correctly at exercise creation time.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">9Feb2012: Add an "About" button to the executable to show version information.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">10Feb2012: Add a "re-run" button next to exercise button</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">10Feb2012: Add seeoutColor, and change IfThen1.cpp to use red for false and blue for true</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">13Feb2012: memory leak example exercise, hash function example exercise, exercise that demonstrates the computational difference in the P versus NP problem. &nbsp;Intermediate exercise section structure needs an "algorithms" or "methods and practices" or "computer science issues" or some such type of section.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">12Feb2012: Make Beginner Qt exercise which shows circle with radius, and GUI "grab" button where radius intersects circle, with right triangle drawn from that intersection down to a line on the x or y axis, showing how the ratio of the two vertices of the right triangle changes as you move the grab button around, to visually illustrate sine.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">15Feb2012: Create plan for how user will add and organize multiple-file user-designed projects for integration into fwc.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">15Feb2012: Design simple game for the purpose of figuring out how we want to design the event-handling framework.</span></li>

<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">24Jan2012: Create How To Use the QtCreator IDE walkthrough in this documentation.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">24Jan2012: Add gitlearn repo to github/gitorious/sourceforge, and add walkthrough to this documentation? &nbsp;gitlearn should NOT be located under ~FeetWetCoding, I don't think... otherwise the FeetWetCoding repo will try to track all the gitlearn .git stuff...? &nbsp;Or just put gitlearn in FeetWetCoding and add ~FeetWetCoding/help/gitlearn to .gitignore? &nbsp;Also, if we put gitlearn up on github/etc., consider the possibility that some people will start pushing vulgar garbage up to the stories of the families on the server repo... can we make the repo read-only up there?</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">24Jan2012: Change all .bmp files in this doc library to .png or something compressed.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">24Jan2012: Source/Compiler/Linker build process analogy: &nbsp;Recipe/Ingredients &amp; Chef/Kitchen.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">27Jan2012: Go back and change absolute paths in helpndoc for images to relative paths.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: Add the idea of "Track 1" and "Track 2" to documentation, also talk about learning how to learn c++. &nbsp;Track 1 being C++ centric, Track 2 being "trying to get to using Qt as early as possible." &nbsp;Exercises numbered 500 and below should be the ones they need to do Track 2.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: Talk about "utility learning", where you don't just learn every tool like you are memorizing vocabulary, but every time you wonder if you could make a program to do a certain thing, you try it out in the source/mycode dir. &nbsp;Learning is easier and more fun when you try to bring an idea to life, rather than just trying to memorize language elements and concepts. &nbsp;"You can't wait for everything to be explained to you. &nbsp;You have to learn to dig on your own! &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts15">Your learning will only stall when you stop asking questions.</span><span class="rvts10">"</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: Add instructions for how to use source/mycode and include/myinclude.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: create gotcha for FeetWetCodingFiles/img/BUILD_ISSUE-DuplicatesInProFile.png</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: Explain helpndoc documentation process in case anyone is thinking of contributing, and that we can't merge changes in .hnd file. &nbsp;Discuss issues of having a wiki, and the plan for online documentation, as well as the need to have the docs included in the distro.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">31Jan2012: Explain that there are better ways to draw things on the screen with image files, but the Draw__ functions help them learn the coordinate space and that for the rest of the exercises they need to know these draw functions.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">1Feb2012: &nbsp;Make images for How To Use FeetWetCoding that show double-click, CTRL-C on exercise name in 000_name.cpp file, double-click CTRL-V on exercise name in main.cpp.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">1Feb2012: probably better come up with something more manageable than this todo list...</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">5Feb2012: figure out our revision roadmap: &nbsp;when do we get to v0.0.2? &nbsp;v0.1.0? &nbsp;write up a plan and make a page for it in this documentation.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">5Feb2012: Remove old project name from how to image files.</span></li>
