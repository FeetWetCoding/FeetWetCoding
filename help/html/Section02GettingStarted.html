<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts34">Getting Started</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Welcome to FeetWetCoding! &nbsp;This section, "Getting Started" introduces you to the basics of how you will get information from your program onto the screen. &nbsp;Traditionally, if you started to learn C++, you would get your program's output by using the cout operator. &nbsp;With FeetWetCoding, you will be able to get output using something very similar that we have setup for you to use, called "seeout." &nbsp;You will also be able to draw simple graphics on the screen, which you will use in later sections to see what your program is doing in a visual way.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Most C++ texts start off with about 50 pages of discussion of types, variables and basic syntax. &nbsp;There's a good reason they do that, but with FeetWetCoding, we want you to jump right in and get your feet wet! &nbsp;So we start off by showing you how to actually make your program </span><span class="rvts15">do</span><span class="rvts10"> something: &nbsp;draw stuff on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Now it turns out that without types, variables and all that other jazz, you can't really do much just by drawing things on the screen with the tools you are going to learn in this section. &nbsp;But as you learn the other stuff, you will already know how to at least display the new tools and features of C++ on the screen, so that you get some visual sense of what your program is trying to do.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts14">Exercise Help Page Format</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Each exercise help page will start with the list of subjects you will learn, like this:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In this exercise, you will learn:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">First, one thing.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Then, another.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Then a terse explanation of what the exercise is trying to do.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Then some hints on how to get to the solution.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The above should be terse. &nbsp;After I summarize, I can babble all I want, but I don't want to waste the users time up at the top of the exercise description.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts14">Note to Self</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Also, discuss the issue here on this page that in learning programming, it is important to be go off on the side and create small programs outside the exercises on their own, to play with their own ideas. &nbsp;Maybe it would be appropriate to go over how to make new .cpp and .h files in Qt Creator up front, rather than at Ch01-S09 Functions, so they can start making their own files in mysource and myinclude, right up front? &nbsp;Just cover what they need to have in those files with screenshots, and how to tell common .pro file errors like duplicate lines and missing \ trailing chars... hm. &nbsp;Maybe better to tell them to leave .pro file alone. &nbsp;I begin to foresee getting broken .pro files to diagnose in email in my future... :) &nbsp;maybe write a perl script to check .pro files for duplicate lines, and missing/extra trailing \</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...or maybe just tell them, "you can create new .cpp files in mysource, and new .h files in myincludes, but if you rename them later, </span><span class="rvts15">make sure the .pro file is not open in the edit window</span><span class="rvts10">." &nbsp;sheesh, maybe that guy on google+ was right and IDEs are not the way to go for beginning programmers, LOL.</span></p>
