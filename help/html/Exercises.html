<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">C++ comes from the language C, or to put it more formally, C++ is a superset of C. &nbsp;You need to know the basics of C in order to move on to the newer ideas that C++ provides about how a programming language should work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It turns out that the way you design a program in C is pretty different from the way you do it in C++. &nbsp;Many people who want to learn C++ wonder if they should "learn C first." &nbsp;The answer is "yes, and no." &nbsp;Yes, you need to learn the basic commands, variable types, syntax, and so on that were originally designed in C because C++ uses all of that. &nbsp;But if you want to learn C++, you do not first need to program strictly in C for a long time and then "step up" to C++ when you feel you have mastered C. &nbsp;You can do that if you want, but it is not necessary to master C first in order to learn C++.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Many people like the C programming language, and still use it today. &nbsp;The Linux kernel is written in C. &nbsp;There is nothing wrong with learning C and being a C programmer, if that is what you want to do. &nbsp;But FeetWetCoding is intended to help you learn C++.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This learning framework is to be used </span><span class="rvts15">in conjunction with a C++ textbook or other educational coursework.</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;Someone who was very determined might be able to figure out how C++ works just from these exercises, but trying to do it that way would be </span><span class="rvts15">tremendously</span><span class="rvts10"> more difficult than if you have a good C++ book to refer to. &nbsp;There have already been many great C++ books written, and it is not the goal of the FeetWetCoding project to reproduce that work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">What this means is that FeetWetCoding does not explain everything about C++. &nbsp;The exercises assume you have read, or have access to, some kind of C++ reference material. &nbsp;Here in this help documentation, we provide links to online C++ (and other) references such as:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts7"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first thing you must do if you have not already is to purchase the following book. &nbsp;It is indispensible. &nbsp;If you do not have K&amp;R on the shelf, you are not a </span><a class="rvts12" href="TheStoryofMel.html">Real Programmer</a><span class="rvts10">! :-)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">The C Programming Language</a><span class="rvts10"> Kernighan &amp; Ritchie</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...but seriously, it is a good book, and a classic. &nbsp;At the very least, check it out from your local library, and give it a look-through!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Here are C++ books we own that we have used ourselves, and we can recommend them on that basis:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Linux-Days/dp/0672318954">Sams Teach Yourself C++ for Linux in 21 Days</a><span class="rvts10"> Liberty &amp; Horvath -- This is Robert's favorite C++ book. &nbsp;Everything is well organized, and the authors are very clear and complete in their explanations. &nbsp;This book is </span><span class="rvts15">enjoyable</span><span class="rvts10"> to read and learn from, which is an achievement for a technical book.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The Chapter structure is intended to ensure that exercises and documentation can be added in the future without disrupting the existing structure. &nbsp;We will probably never actually provide material for all the topics listed there, even with the help of other collaborators that might join our project as time goes by. &nbsp;But after redesigning the exercise structure and renaming exercise filenames several times (a tedious process), we realized that we need to have a general overview structure in place so that new material can be easily inserted. &nbsp;This is the reason so many of the chapters are empty: &nbsp;it is not that we are so ambitious, it is that we are tired of renaming files and directories over and over!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps27"><span class="rvts10">Anyone who is inclined to contribute to FeetWetCoding is welcome, and we will consider all exercise or documentation submissions for inclusion in the project. &nbsp;We do want to at least </span><span class="rvts15">try</span><span class="rvts10"> to maintain a standard of quality and coherence among the exercises and the documentation, and any submission will, of course, have to meet that standard to be included in the project. &nbsp;It is entirely possible that a proposed exercise or documentation change might be excellent, and yet might not fit in with the way FeetWetCoding tries to present this information. &nbsp;We have a certain way we want this project to develop, and any potential contributors must understand that we will insist on sticking to that way. &nbsp;If you have an interest in contributing to FeetWetCoding, please </span><a class="rvts58" href="ContactUs.html">contact us first</a><span class="rvts10"> before you put in a lot of work on your own, so that we can work together productively and successfully. &nbsp;And of course, anyone who would like to use FeetWetCoding as the basis of their own C++ learning framework project, for example with Eclipse, Visual Studio, OpenGL, wxWidgets, etc., is welcome to fork off of our code and roll their own. &nbsp;However, before forking, consider that it might save you a lot of work by collaborating with us instead! &nbsp;:-)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note: &nbsp;Every FeetWetCoding exercise source code file will have a page of documentation supporting it. &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts15">Not every page of documentation will have source code associated with it.</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;There is supporting documentation here for subjects related to C++, but which are not actually about C++ programming.</span></p>
