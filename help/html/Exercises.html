<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts34"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps33"><span class="rvts84">"Talk is cheap. &nbsp;Show me the code." -- Linus Torvalds</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">(NOTE: Many software projects make the mistake of allowing their documentation to lag far behind the software development itself, and this project is no exception. &nbsp;Good documentation is a big priority for us, but our software has changed so much in the past few months that we realized it is not a good use of our time to try to document a moving target. &nbsp;Further down the road, we will be able to write up the help for each individual exercise, but as of Spring 2012, that stuff just doesn't exist. &nbsp;Sorry! &nbsp;We promise we will get to it!)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps9"><span class="rvts11">It is important that you do the exercises in order, even the reference exercises. &nbsp;The later exercises use things you learn in the earlier ones.</span><br><span class="rvts10"></span><br><span class="rvts10">If you are a beginner, be sure to do the exercises numbered 000-499 in each section. &nbsp;The exercises will make more sense if you do them in order: &nbsp;later exercises build on concepts and topics covered in earlier ones. &nbsp;Exercises numbered 500 and above can sometimes include topics and language elements that have not yet been covered and the number 500+ exercises can safely be postponed until later if they are confusing. &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts11">If you do the 000-499 exercises in each section, you should be able to safely move on to the next section and make good progress.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">C++ comes from the language C, or to put it more formally, C++ is a superset of C. &nbsp;You need to know the basics of C in order to move on to the newer ideas that C++ provides about how a programming language should work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">It turns out that the way you design a program in C is pretty different from the way you do it in C++. &nbsp;Many people who want to learn C++ wonder if they should "learn C first." &nbsp;The answer is "yes, and no." &nbsp;Yes, you need to learn the basic commands, variable types, syntax, and so on that were originally designed in C because C++ uses all of that. &nbsp;But if you want to learn C++, you do not first need to program strictly in C for a long time and then "step up" to C++ when you feel you have mastered C. &nbsp;You can do that if you want, but it is not necessary to master C first in order to learn C++.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Many people like the C programming language, and still use it today. &nbsp;The Linux kernel is written in C. &nbsp;There is nothing wrong with learning C and being a C programmer, if that is what you want to do. &nbsp;But FeetWetCoding is intended to help you learn C++.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This learning framework is to be used </span><span class="rvts15">in conjunction with a C++ textbook or other educational coursework.</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;Someone who was very determined might be able to figure out how C++ works just from these exercises, but trying to do it that way would be </span><span class="rvts15">tremendously</span><span class="rvts10"> more difficult than if you have a good C++ book to refer to. &nbsp;There have already been many great C++ books written, and it is not the goal of the FeetWetCoding project to reproduce everything contained in those books.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">What this means is that FeetWetCoding does not explain everything about C++.&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts10"> The exercises assume you have read, or have access to, some kind of C++ reference material. &nbsp;Here in this help documentation, we provide links to online C++ (and other) references such as:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts7"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The first thing you must do if you have not already is to purchase the following book. &nbsp;It is indispensible. &nbsp;If you do not have K&amp;R on the shelf, you are not a </span><a class="rvts12" href="TheStoryofMel.html">Real Programmer</a><span class="rvts10">! :-)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">The C Programming Language</a><span class="rvts10"> Kernighan &amp; Ritchie</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...but seriously, it is a good book, and a classic. &nbsp;At the very least, check it out from your local library, and give it a look-through!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Here are C++ books we own that we have used ourselves, and we can recommend them on that basis:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><a class="rvts12" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Linux-Days/dp/0672318954">Sams Teach Yourself C++ for Linux in 21 Days</a><span class="rvts10"> Liberty &amp; Horvath -- This is Robert's favorite C++ book. &nbsp;Everything is well organized, and the authors are very clear and complete in their explanations. &nbsp;This book is </span><span class="rvts15">enjoyable</span><span class="rvts10"> to read and learn from, which is an achievement for a technical book.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The Chapter structure is intended to ensure that exercises and documentation can be added in the future without disrupting the existing structure. &nbsp;We will probably never actually provide material for all the topics listed there, even with the help of other collaborators that might join our project as time goes by. &nbsp;But after redesigning the exercise structure and renaming exercise filenames several times (a tedious process), we realized that we need to have a general overview structure in place so that new material can be easily inserted. &nbsp;This is the reason so many of the chapters are empty: &nbsp;it is not that we are so ambitious, it is that we are tired of renaming files and directories over and over!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Note: &nbsp;Every FeetWetCoding exercise source code file will have a page of documentation supporting it. &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts15">Not every page of documentation will have source code associated with it.</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;There is supporting documentation here for subjects related to C++, but which are not actually about C++ programming.</span></p>
