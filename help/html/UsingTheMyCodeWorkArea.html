<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts48"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts48">The MyCode work area in FeetWetCoding is a very useful way for you to:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Write your own programs outside of the exercise structure.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Test out an idea or language feature without stepping all over existing exercise code, or having to comment that exercise code out.</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">A handy place to keep a bunch of functions that you find useful and want to reuse again and again as you learn, by cutting and pasting from your personal MyCode library of functions and classes that you will write over time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts46">If you are new to C++, you will need to have done some exercises before this MyCode thing will make any sense to you.</span><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp;Once you hit Section05 "Loops_Logic", you may begin to want to start writing your own programs from scratch, and we strongly encourage you to do that! &nbsp;So if you read this page and it doesn't make any sense, don't worry about that. &nbsp;Just keep working exercises, and come back here after you have done some of the Loops_Logic exercises, and check this info out again then.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">The MyCode "work area" is just a set of empty source files that live under the fwc home directory--wherever you unzipped the fwc .zip file you originally downloaded when you were getting started with fwc.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">MyCode consists of the following files:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode0.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode1.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode2.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode3.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode4.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode5.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode6.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode7.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode8.cpp</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">mycode/src/MyCode9.cpp</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">...as well as the files under mycode/include. &nbsp;You will learn what includes are in Section00 SOME FUTURE SECTION. (DEVNOTE: SEE </span><a class="rvts47" href="http://code.google.com/p/feetwetcoding/issues/detail?id=74" target="_blank">GOOGLE CODE ISSUE #74</a><span class="rvts45">).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">The way you run specific exercise code is to select that exercise at runtime from the dropdown list buttons on the fwc window for Chapter, Section and Exercise. &nbsp;The MyCode "chapter" can be selected from the Chapter dropdown list on the fwc window.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">fwc is setup this way to make it easy to choose a specific exercise at runtime, but this means that adding a new program or exercise to these dropdown lists on the fwc window is just not something a beginning programmer will be able to do until they have more coding experience. &nbsp;And yet, beginners </span><span class="rvts46">need</span><span class="rvts45"> to be able to write their own programs to test out new ideas!</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps44"><span class="rvts145">One of the best ways to learn programming is not just to do the exercises we give you, but also to go off and try things on your own.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">One way you could do this is to write your program idea by overwriting the source files for exercises that you have already completed. &nbsp;But then you have to remember that your asteroid game project </span><span class="rvts46">really</span><span class="rvts45"> lives in C01S02/010_ChangeText.cpp or whatever, and that's sort of irritating to have to remember that. &nbsp;So let's not do it that way.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Instead, just use the MyCode source files that already exist. &nbsp;They start off almost empty, so you can fill them up with whatever you want.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">MyCode gives you a place for </span><span class="rvts46">your</span><span class="rvts45"> programs. &nbsp;Think up your own ideas of what you can do with the tools you are learning. &nbsp;Try new things out. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to experiment. &nbsp;The MyCode work area gives you ten C++ files to do that in. &nbsp;If you use up all ten, just copy the MyCodeX.cpp file you have been using the </span><span class="rvts46">least</span><span class="rvts45"> to another directory where you can keep permanent copies of the software you write. &nbsp;Then you can use that MyCodeX.cpp slot for a new program idea.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Again, if you have not yet completed at least the Section05 Loops_Logic exercises, you will probably not have much use for this MyCode thing.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Here is an example of how to use MyCode:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Type the code in the red circle into MyCode1.cpp and run fwc:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/MyCodeHowTo1.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">...then choose MyCode1 in the FWC application:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/MyCodeHowTo2.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts166">GOOD</span><span class="rvts153"> ENGINEERS KEEP THEIR TOOLS CLEAN AND ORDERLY!</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">We all let our filesystems get messy and disorganized, with files and folders and images and crap all over the place in a big mess. &nbsp;I do it, you've done it--it happens.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">But something that will save your bacon as you are learning coding is to man up or woman up and </span><span class="rvts46">do the tedious housekeeping chores you need to do to keep your files well-organized</span><span class="rvts45">. &nbsp;Try to build up the habit in yourself of going through your files and directories once a week (or at LEAST once a month!) and clean out the crap. &nbsp;Think about what you have named things. &nbsp;Do the names make sense? &nbsp;Are they clear and descriptive? &nbsp;Do they make sense only to you, or will they make sense to others? &nbsp;Choosing good names for things is important not just in coding, but in any computer work.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts46">Pick a date scheme for filenames, and try to stick with it.&nbsp;</span><span class="rvts45"> Over the years I have come to use dates in the form of 2012Mar19, and I use that in my filenames, where dates are important. &nbsp;For example the zip file I created for this documentation (to put it up on our website) is named</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">fwcdocsV0.2r1-2012Mar19.zip</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">...that tells me that the file is:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">...a .zip file</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">it contains the FeetWetCoding documentation (fwcdocs)</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">...for version 0.2 release 1</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">and I zipped the docs up on 2012Mar19, or March 19, 2012</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Why put the date in the filename when the file already has a date associated with it (that the Operating System remembers)? &nbsp;Because that date can get lost. &nbsp;I might copy a file without a date in the filename at some time in the future, and start using the copy, and the original date will be gone. &nbsp;I don't always add a date to every filename I create, but for some of them, it is important.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">However, you can't really go wrong putting dates on everything, and you never know when it will turn out to be immensely valuable. &nbsp;Put the date in code you write, documentation you make and </span><span class="rvts163">PUT THE DATE OF AUTHORSHIP ON </span><span class="rvts164">EVERY</span><span class="rvts163"> FRICKIN WEBPAGE YOU EVER MAKE!!!!</span><span class="rvts45"> Put dates everywhere!!! &nbsp;:-D</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts45">Also, </span><span class="rvts46">get out of the habit of using spaces in your filenames!</span><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp;Many windows users do this. &nbsp;As a programmer, you will soon learn that this causes you problems. &nbsp;It's a good habit to break. &nbsp;Instead of filenames, you can use the dash character - or the underscore _ which will break up the words in the name so they are more readable, and yet not use spaces which makes working with files in your programming a pain.</span></p>
