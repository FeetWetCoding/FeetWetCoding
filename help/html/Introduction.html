<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Here are the goals of the FeetWetCoding learning framework:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">The core design goal of FeetWetCoding is to get the person who is trying to learn C++ to start working with the compiler and actively changing source code from day one, rather than passively reading a textbook. &nbsp;Textbooks on C++ are necessary to the learning process, and there are some great ones out there, but programming is not a passive activity. &nbsp;Unlike many other disciplines, </span><span class="rvts11">you can't really learn programming by reading alone</span><span class="rvts10">: &nbsp;you </span><span class="rvts11">must</span><span class="rvts10"> get your hands dirty by modifying and running programs in order to learn how to program.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">With FeetWetCoding, one of our primary goals is to ensure that once someone downloads our software package, they have all the necessary information they need to start coding within minutes. &nbsp;We want to completely eliminate the confusing and overwhelming experience that too many beginners have to go through in googling forums and websites to just get their very first program to even compile and run!</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding tries to give the new programmer the ability to do some simple graphical programming early, which makes programming more fun and intuitive. &nbsp;These days, in order to draw anything on the screen, you must have some idea of how to use classes and how event-driven programming works. &nbsp;This is a real shame for the beginner, because in the early days of personal computing, the beginning programmer was able to have the experience of drawing on the screen in the first day or two of coding. &nbsp;The graphics may have been crude, and the language (BASIC) may have been limited, but it sure was a lot more fun to learn that way than with all this "cin" and "cout" drudgery! &nbsp;Learning to program by using cout is not nearly as fun as even the simplest graphical programs!</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding will always be an Open Source project, and will always be not only "free as in freedom", but "free as in beer" for individuals who want to learn C++.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding intends to help beginning programmers learn C and C++ from within the QtCreator (pronounced "cute creator") SDK (Software Developer's Kit) using the Qt (pronounced "cute") programming library. &nbsp;We chose Qt and QtCreator because they are free to individuals, and QtCreator SDK spares the beginning programmer the overwhelming task of mucking about trying to get WxWidgets or some other rendering library set up in the build toolchain, before they can even write "Hello World"! &nbsp;Qt works well on Windows PCs, Macs and Linux boxes. &nbsp;Qt and Qt Creator have a large user base, and the documentation for Qt is excellent. &nbsp;Qt and QtCreator solve some annoying problems for us, and they do it elegantly and free of charge.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Here in North America, the pronunciation of Qt as "cute" does sound a little odd and, well, cutesy, to the ear of many engineers and programmers. &nbsp;But the Qt people wrote it, and they get to decide what it is called and how to pronounce it, and that is how they pronounce it! &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;And anyways, for many people, pronouncing it as "que tee" means QT or Quick Time. &nbsp;Don't confuse Qt with QT, they have nothing to do with each other.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">Here is what </span><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding</span><span class="rvts18"> is NOT:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18"><br></span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding is not a way to learn Python, Java, WxWidgets, OpenGL, or any other language or software library besides C++/Qt. &nbsp;We (or someone else) may expand the FeetWetCoding concept in the future to introduce other languages and libraries, but that does not exist at the time this document was written.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding does not work with Eclipse, NetBeans, VisualStudio, or any other development environment besides Qt and QtCreator. &nbsp;Again, we may try to adapt FeetWetCoding to other build environments and tools at some point, but there is no plan to even </span><span class="rvts15">start</span><span class="rvts10"> to think about that at the current time.</span></li>
<li class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">FeetWetCoding is NOT a complete, official, academic style textbook way to learn C++! &nbsp;You will need to get a good C++ textbook, either one that we recommend, or another one. &nbsp;If you intend to make programming your career, you will benefit greatly from proper academic instruction. &nbsp;FeetWetCoding</span><span class="rvts11"> does not, and never will claim to be a complete, authoritative, formal way to learn C++.</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;We try to teach the right things the right way, and it is a core goal for us that we never teach bad habits. &nbsp;If you are an experienced programmer and you see something in the exercises that you think is teaching bad programming habits, your feedback is welcome. &nbsp;We may have reasons for doing things the way we are doing them, but we will always listen to feedback on the exercises. &nbsp;We sincerely want to get those exercises as right as we can.</span></li>
