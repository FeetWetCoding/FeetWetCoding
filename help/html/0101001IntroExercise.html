<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts17">Chapter 01, Exercise 01: &nbsp;Intro Exercise</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Welcome to your first C++ program!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts17">NOTE: You NEED to read the help page </span><a class="rvts37" href="HowtoUseFeetWetCoding.html">How to Use FeetWetCoding</a><span class="rvts17"> to understand how to use the FeetWetCoding exercises! &nbsp; And if you haven't already installed Qt Creator, you NEED to read the </span><a class="rvts37" href="InstallQtCreator.html">Install QtCreator</a><span class="rvts17"> help page and follow the instructions there or you will not be able to use FeetWetCoding at all. &nbsp; </span><span class="rvts46">If you have not read those pages and completed the instructions there, &nbsp;please do so now.</span><span class="rvts17"> &nbsp;Don't worry: &nbsp;I'll wait here. &nbsp;:-)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In this exercise you are going to learn two basic things:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li value="1" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">What a comment is, and what effect it has on your code.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">What the FeetWetCoding drawing area looks like.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">If you are brand new to programming, there is a lot of lingo to learn. &nbsp;Don't be intimidated if you do not understand everything. &nbsp;Keep working with the exercises and don't give up!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When we talk about "code" we mean the C++ instructions that tell the computer what to do. &nbsp;As you work with these exercises, you will be changing the text of the code to try to get the program to behave correctly when it runs. &nbsp;That's the basic essence of how we do programming--we tweak the text of our code to try to make it do what we want.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In the C++ programming language, any line that starts with // is a </span><span class="rvts15">comment</span><span class="rvts10">, and the computer just ignores everything on the rest of that line that follows the // characters. &nbsp;Programmers use comments in their code to tell other programmers what they meant when they wrote the code the way they did. &nbsp;Comments are a sort of "private" communication between programmers, that the general public never sees! And now you are in on the big secret! You know something non-programmers don't know!!! :-D</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Comments explain to programmers what is happening in the part of the source file that the computer *does* pay attention to: &nbsp;the C++ code. &nbsp;Any line that doesn't start with // is NOT a comment, but is the C++ code that tells the computer what to do. &nbsp; It is important to understand this, because any line that starts with // will be ignored when the program runs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts11">But the real reason you are learning about comments right up front here is that using // to "comment out" a line of code is an easy way to turn something in your program off, so you can see what effect it has when you run it. &nbsp;It is important for you to know, right at the beginning, that any line in your program that starts with // </span><span class="rvts48">will not actually do anything!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">This exercise also introduces the drawing area to you. &nbsp;THIS IS JUST AN INTRODUCTION! &nbsp;You are not supposed to understand what is going on yet. &nbsp;This is just to give you a little taste of what a C++ program looks like--to let you start to get your feet wet!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">In this program, before you change anything, the only thing that gets drawn when your program runs is the gray reference box with the x,y coordinates on its corners. &nbsp;This helps you understand how the drawing area is laid out. &nbsp;This box is drawn by the DrawReferenceBox line of code near the bottom of the program file </span><span class="rvts11">a0005.cpp</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; The ".cpp" here means C Plus Plus, which is how C++ is pronounced. &nbsp;We don't name our files like </span><span class="rvts11">filename.c++</span><span class="rvts10"> because the '+' character is a "special character" for some systems, and having the '+' character in the filename can cause problems.)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Go ahead and run this program right now before reading further, so you can see what it does, before you make any changes to it. &nbsp;Click the "Run" button (the green triangle) in the lower left corner of the Qt Creator window.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">You should have seen a window appear with a grey box inside it slightly smaller than the whole window area, with numbers near the corners of the box, separated by commas, like this:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><img border="0" alt hspace="1" vspace="1" src="lib/NewItem.png"></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts18">When you are done looking at the running program, don't forget to click the 'X' of the window of the running program to close it!</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;Once your program is running, if you make any changes to its code in Qt Creator, &nbsp;the green "start" arrow button will not work again until you first close the program that is already running. &nbsp;This will come up again: &nbsp;I do it all the time!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">So, to repeat, </span><span class="rvts11">this process works</span><span class="rvts10">:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li value="1" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Edit your program.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Run your program.</span></li>
<li value="3" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Close your program window (NOT the Qt Creator window!)</span></li>
<li value="4" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Go back to step 1.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...but </span><span class="rvts11">this process does </span><span class="rvts18">NOT</span><span class="rvts11"> work</span><span class="rvts10">:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li value="1" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Edit your program.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Run your program.</span></li>
<li value="3" class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Try to go back to step 1 without first closing your running program.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When you forget to close the running program, and then you edit it and try to run it again, you will get this error in the Issues pane of the Qt Creator window:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts45">:-1: error: cannot open output file debug\FeetWetCoding.exe: Permission denied</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps23"><span class="rvts15">This is almost guaranteed to happen to you in the future, so if you changed something in your program and suddenly it won't run at all, this is the first thing you need to check: &nbsp;did you forget to close the running program before making new changes?</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">For the rest of this exercise you will uncomment lines one at a time, and then compile and run the program so that you can clearly understand what each line does. &nbsp;Remember to only uncomment lines which are not obviously English sentences! &nbsp;If you uncomment English (or any other spoken language) sentences in a program, the program will not work. &nbsp;The day may come when we can tell computers what to do by speaking English to them, but that day is not here yet. &nbsp;:-)</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Now, uncomment the first line of C++ code--NOT the first line in the file! &nbsp;Uncomment the first DrawLine starting &nbsp;with "// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawLine" by removing &nbsp;the first two // characters, and compile and run the program to see what it does. &nbsp;Change this:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawLine(50,0,50,100,3,BLUE);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...to this:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawLine(50,0,50,100,3,BLUE);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">...and then run the program by clicking the "Run" button (the green arrow.) &nbsp;Did you have any idea what was going to be drawn on the screen? &nbsp;It is OK if you didn't guess beforehand, but as you go, if you want to, you can try to see why the numbers between the parentheses make the shapes appear on the screen in the way they do.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Now uncomment the next "Draw..." line and run, and repeat for each subsequent line, one-at-a-time:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts7"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawCircle(300,100,100,3,RED, false);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawCircle(350,150,100,3,BLUE,true);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawCircle(550,150,100,3,BLUE,true);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawCircle(500,100,100,3,YELLOW,false);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawRectangle(50,250,700,300,3,BLACK,true);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawEllipse(400,400,30,70,3,BLUE);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawEllipse(350,400,30,70,3,YELLOW,false);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawEllipse(450,400,30,70,3,RED,true);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawRectangle(100,300,600,200,3,RED);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawLine(0,0,800,600,1,PINK);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45">// &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawLine(0,600,800,0,1,GREEN);</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">All the circles and lines and so on are finally being drawn on the screen. &nbsp;The last thing you will do in this exercise is:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Now that all the shapes are being drawn, comment out the following line of code so that you</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp; &nbsp;// can see exactly what DrawReferenceBox does by adding // at the beginning of the line:</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp; &nbsp;DrawReferenceBox(false, false); &nbsp; &nbsp; // draw the graphical reference frame</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts45"> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Now you can check out DrawingAreaIntroSoln to make sure you got it right!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps24"><span class="rvts10">Remember: &nbsp;you </span><span class="rvts15">comment out</span><span class="rvts10"> a line of code by </span><span class="rvts15">adding</span><span class="rvts10"> the // characters to the beginning of that line.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Congratulations! &nbsp;You have completed your first FeetWetCoding exercise. &nbsp;Change </span><span class="rvts11">IntroExercise</span><span class="rvts10"> to </span><span class="rvts11">IntroExerciseSoln</span><span class="rvts10"> in </span><span class="rvts11">main.cpp</span><span class="rvts10">, and check out the file </span><span class="rvts11">a0005soln.cpp</span><span class="rvts10"> and you will be able to compare your work with the exercise solution!</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">Also, you are free to change the numbers in the () of each line, and re-run your program to see what change it might make in how the shapes get drawn on the screen. &nbsp;If you make changes to the point where the program won't run anymore, you can restore a0005.cpp to it's original form by copying it from the exercises/orig directory. &nbsp;exercises/orig contains all the exercise .cpp files in their original form, so that you can start over if you make changes to your program that you want to completely undo.</span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts10">When you are ready, you can proceed to </span><a class="rvts12" href="0101002TextontheScreen.html">Ex 01-02: Text on the Screen</a><span class="rvts10">.</span></p>
