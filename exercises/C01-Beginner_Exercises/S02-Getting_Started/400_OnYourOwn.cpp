    // OMGOMG!!11!!  No code here!  Looks like you're going to have to write it
    // all yourself!  :-D

    // As you proceed through the exercises, you will see files with names like
    // 060_C01S05_OYO1.cpp.  OYO here stands for "On Your Own" and in these OYO
    // exercises, you will need to use the knowledge from previous exercises and
    // write the whole program yourself.  You can do it!  And if you get stuck
    // for ideas, refer back to previous exercises, and do some reading in your
    // textbook.

    // If you are finding this learning difficult, and you are frustrated, remember:

    //             ANYTHING WORTH HAVING IN THIS LIFE HAS A COST.

    // If you don't pay the cost, you can't have the thing!  Sometimes we earn our
    // learning by paying the cost of frustration.  :-D
